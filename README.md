# DBT CERT POSTGRES

Repository created to keep a track of all courses done to get dbt Analytics Engineering  Certification

The guide to follow is [this](https://www.getdbt.com/assets/uploads/dbt_certificate_study_guide.pdf).

## PRE-REQUISITES

Regardless, technical knowledge, you must install:

- Docker (we will use a postgres image)
- Python (in our case Python 3.9.7)

## FIRST STEPS

You can see changes [here](https://github.com/davidmunoz4185/dbt_cert/pull/1/files).

### DATABASE SETUP

Start a Postgres Database using docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

It will create the directory _postgres-data-db-volume_ where postgres stores data and metadata database.

You can check everything is ok connecting with following config:

- __host__: localhost
- __port__: 6432
- __user__: postgres
- __pass__: postgres
- __db__: jaffle_shop

### PYTHON INSTALL REQUIREMENTS

Verify your python version

```BASH
python --version
Python 3.9.7
```

Create a virtual env

```BASH
python -m venv .env
```

Activate virtual env

```BASH
source .env/Scripts/activate
```

Upgrade pip

```BASH
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Install requirements

```BASH
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### INIT DBT PROJECT

```BASH
dbt init
08:36:03  Running with dbt=1.7.7
Enter a name for your project (letters, digits, underscore): dbt_get_certification
08:36:52  
Your new dbt project "dbt_get_certification" was created!

- Add seed files

### ADD RAW DATA

Load seed files in postgres

```BASH
dbt seed
```
